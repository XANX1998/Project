          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Launched in 2010, our technology platform connects customers, restaurant partners, and delivery partners, 
            serving their multiple needs. Customers use our platform to search and discover restaurants, 
            read and write customer-generated reviews, view and upload photos, order food delivery, book a table, 
            and make payments while dining out at restaurants. 
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
            On the other hand, we provide restaurant partners with industry-specific marketing tools that 
            enable them to engage and acquire customers to grow their business, while also providing a reliable 
            and efficient last-mile delivery service. 
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
            We also operate a one-stop procurement solution, Hyperpure, which supplies high-quality ingredients 
            and kitchen products to restaurant partners. We provide our delivery partners with transparent 
            and flexible earning opportunities.
